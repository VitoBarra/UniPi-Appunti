[11.9s] I'm a junior professor, probably from the Department of Pharmacy, University of Pisa, and I'm a teacher of the part of this course related to  [3.7s] I hope I have time to tell you the intro lecture and a little bit of the other one because I have many things to say, to tell you, but don't be scared because that's the other point. In the slides, they will be available for everybody. You will find plenty of information, so you don't need to gather other information related to this topic from other sources. You'll have plenty of that. And I won't ask you Everything. So, you don't have a Google to tell you. So, the typical message is that you have everything you need to study in the slides. So, that's why sometimes I'm going maybe a little bit faster, sometimes I'll go slower depending on the importance of the argument. For example, for molecular dynamics, I will be, I will go a little bit slower because it's an important topic and I will give you the hints necessary for you to understand the topics, but I won't go expressly in details about that script. So, and if you go to the Moomin page and try to download the PDF, you will be asked for a password. The password is  [3.3s] M-M-E-S-L, with no caption letters like that. Also for downloading and for opening  [3.8s] and BSL. Anytime you have to open the PDF, it just says,  [3.9s] and an essay, so you can read the first two PDFs on the slides. So, just briefly, I'm a molecular modeler, so in my research activities, I actually do  [1.4s] almost everything I'm going to teach you so I'm specializing this I'm a medicinal chemist that has been focused last  [7.6s] If we start counting from the master  [3.6s] You can find the picture of me when I'm in the camera because I am, but I'm not at all. So anyway, I've focused my research activity in pure computational chemistry, pure molecular modeling. And so the area of medicinal chemistry and the area of molecular modeling or computational chemistry that I'm going to introduce you. So we are at the boundaries, let's say, the edges of medicinal chemistry and computational chemistry. Computational chemistry, we can do even other types of analysis in respect to ones you will be taught. And of course, it's a combination of medicinal chemistry and computational chemistry.  [1.5s] Feel free to interrupt me whenever you want to say, ah, this is not clear. Sorry, you can ask whatever. So let's start with the introduction to combinational chemistry and the presentation. Here we will find something you already talked about in the previous lecture with Professor  [1.4s] I also am a kiddie, so that's why I'm going rather fast. But if I'm going too fast, just tell me and tell me. We need to slow down a bit. This is not that clear, okay? So, what is compositional chemistry? As I told you, it's a branch of chemistry that explores computer science for solving chemical problems. So it's a branch of chemistry that uses computers, algorithms, and specific softwares to perform particular analysis related to chemistry and mixed chemistry in that specific field that can either try to predict experimental results or trying to predict behaviors, let's say, or hints, or I might say pieces of information that would be hardly obtainable through experimental, through experimental needs, experimental results. Again, also if I speak too fast, just tell me slow down please, okay?  [2.3s] So, actually, computational chemistry is anything, includes any type of chemical-related analysis that you can perform using computers and software. And one of the applications of computational chemistry, because for example, you can use computational chemistry, I don't know, to,  [1.5s] predict the crystal structure of a  [3.5s] or to predict the distribution of the electrons inside the molecule, or to predict some catalytic reactions. And this is not the case of completely created dry design. In fact, computational chemistry includes many different sub-families, like quantum chemistry, which is related to this type.  [1.3s] most of these types of analysis that I told you. Molecular dynamics, molecular homology, molecular mechanics, and chemo-informatics. Many of these applications are related to the study of drugs or better potential drugs and their related biological targets. This is what I'm going to  [1.0s] is computer-aided drug design, so computational chemistry, let's say, restricted to its application in drug design. And to be precise, we wish to rather talk about legal design, not computer-aided drug design, but legal design, because what we actually do, or like a number of others actually,  [1.3s] you do is try to identify new potential ligands, or perform analysis on ligands, or try to compare and evaluate properties of ligands, and you will see what is a ligand. A ligand is a small molecule endowed with some biological And the most general definition of ligand is a small molecule that is able to interact somehow, somewhere, with a certain receptor. A drug is something different. A drug is something that is on the market. It's a molecule that exerts a certain activity, for example, an inflammatory reaction. molecule that interacts with the target is, for example, a potent inhibitor of a certain target, and inhibiting the target has a beneficial effect. So this potent has a very hard action on that target, but it's also safe, doesn't have side effects. It's selected for the target. It doesn't inhibit other targets that are unwanted or won't set effect. It's also easy to distance, size, marketable, it's on the market and we can buy it. That's part of it. And to be a product, a small molecule needs to be optimized many times in different cycles and pass multiple clinical trials, multiple clinical phases and then be  [1.0s] put it in the market and hopefully for the pharmaceutical industry not withdraw due to side effects that are unknown before the market's decision. So that's what we can buy. And a legal is the beginning of this path. It's a molecule, I don't know or identify through which screening, I don't know what it is, but I'll tell you, which is able to interact with a biological target, a receptor. And most of these ligands, in light of this interaction with this target, have a biological effect and so-called bioactive molecule. The next question is, what is a receptor? Receptor is a biological, any biological structure to which a ligand may attach. So a ligand can, a receptor can be a protein. Of course, these are just representation of a protein and also a fatty acid. We will talk about representation of a protein in this lecture and antimonylics. But it's something in general that can receive and interact with a liquid. So it can be an enzyme, something that takes an endogenous molecule and transform it into another endogenous molecule. So it takes the substrate, transform it chemically into the product. It can be another assimilating protein. This is GPCR, G-protein carbon receptor, because it has a typical structure. It's a transmembrane protein. I mean, nobody will trust me. And so it's not designed with something that receives some endogenous ligand, like this green stuff here. And in...  [2.0s] it acts and transforms itself a little bit and transmits a signal that has some effect. It can be a hormonal receptor, for example, a strong receptor that receives estradiol and, sorry, binds to the estradiol and triggers some processes that are related to the functions of the body. But can it be something different? Can it be a nucleic acid? The receptor can be nucleic acid, DNA, RNA, or a ribosome. There is something even more from here. Receptor is anything that welcomes a ligand, that interacts with a ligand. And if this This receptor has a physiological function, and 99.99% of the time it is. Then it has a biological effect, because interacting with the receptor, it alters the physiological work and properties of the receptor. So it alters somehow some physiological process in our body, and so it has a biological effect.  [4.3s] What is your biological and chemical knowledge? I know that you've been introduced to some biological concepts, but judging from your thesis, I don't think you have such a strong chemical background. Don't worry, we'll take it easy. Maybe it will be so in these 10 days. Not much more. Okay, so the environmental background is restricted to the previous 10 days. Right, and some high school memories, but... Okay, high school memories, yes. I will come down on that. Okay, okay. But there has been a refreshing phase in the last 10 years. And how about your chemical background? Same. I don't think you did have a chemical refresh in the late days. I'm not sure. You know what? Professor D'Arruzzo told us how she's a biochemist. I don't know how it's in English. She works in my department. She told you about that. She told you about amino acids, sugars, lipids, I don't know. Do you know how many amino acids we have in the body? What is it? They are the components that build the blocks of the proteins. You know when you have masses?  [2.9s] So if you go to the gym and they sponsor you BCAA, do you know what BCAA is? Branched Chain Amino Acids. They're a small sum of the amino acids, some of them that has a branched shape. Now you will understand, you know what is a branched shape. Because the side shape has some branches.  [1.2s] Anyway, in this field model, what it is? So we told you that ligand is something that binds to a receptor. You know what is a receptor and how this binding happens. Years ago, and years ago now, we used to conceive this interaction between ligand and receptor with a lock and key.  [1.8s] model so rigid ligand that interacts with the receptor that is a that is a sort of lock with a rigid hole that the ligand have to fit in order to create the interaction. It's not like that. Because generally, of course, the receptor is always something, the vial is not that rigid, it has a with a lot of stable conformation, of course, but of course it has some flexibility, and especially at the level of the binding site. So the ligand is a small molecule that of course is able to change its conformation, and we'll talk about conformation in detail, and so it's something flexible, a flexible chemical entity that adjusts its conformation, its position, to feed the receptor. And the receptor, especially at the level of the binding site, adjusts itself to better bind the receptor. So we talk about induced fit model. Because both the ligand and the receptor adopt their conformation to one another. Just like you enter a car that you don't drive. So you enter the car, standing still in front of the car, but if you want to drive, you have to sit there and you have to, you know, but not like this, you have to stay like that. So you adapt your confirmation and start thinking about the way you  [2.5s] Start thinking about your disposition in space as a confirmation. It will be much easier to understand confirmation and confirmation sentiment models. It's not that different, although you may than the opposite. So you adapt your information to fit the car, but you may also adapt the car to fit you. You can regulate the distance of the seat from the steering wheel, and also the height, and also the wheel height. This is an industry problem. It happens like this with the ligand and the protein. The ligand adapts itself to best fit the receptor. The receptor itself, but at the level of the binding site. Because of course, like in the car, you're not changing the overall shape of the car when you get in. But you can change the shape of the binding site. So you are seeing, okay? And that's the same thing with the protein. With the receptor, with the ligand receptor interaction. This allows both ligand and the receptor to increase their reciprocal affinity and to speed up things and to optimize the interaction and also the palliative reaction of enzymes if you are talking about enzymes so to increase the to let the interaction easier. And that's the proof of what I'm saying because here, Okay, for you, these are just two blocks that have no actual meaning, but trust me, they are the representation of the surface onto thought, onto confirmation. And I don't know if you can, but you should be able to see here sort of holes. Both here and both here. Okay? And you see that here the hole is a little bit smaller and here there is a smaller hole here and we have a shallower cavity here. Okay? In this image, the hole at the center of this side is a little bit wider but the entrance is more narrower because this wall, this part of the wall on the blinded side is a little bit moved toward the center, okay? These are two different blinded sides, you would say, but actually These two blobs, these two faces, are just two different conformations of the same enzyme. So, there you have just two dispositions in space of the same protein, which is in an NMP, a matrix, without an Nase.  [2.9s] to be called Julio or, I don't know, John. It's the same. I mean, it doesn't matter this, but it's a real pharmaceutical drug target. And the fact this change in the money side is due to the fact that the legal induces this conformational change. I mean, that's not . Induce this movement.  [1.1s] This purple stuff is the ligand. It's a small molecule. And here you have almost the whole structure of the protein in ribbon representation. I will tell you what's ribbon representation. And you see that this is, trust me, this resin, this is the side chain of the nitrogen.  [1.6s] This is an amino acid here, you see? This portion here and this portion here are the same stuff. You recognize that it's the same, you know? There are the same colors and the same atoms here.  [1.4s] And this ligand, this molecule, by binding to the receptor, moves this side chain, or this amino acid, from here to here. Because if the rest stays here, there's no space for the ligand to get in. So the ligand pushes away this amino acid. This is just an example of inkyuski molecule. Let's start talking now about molecular modeling in terms of representation of molecules and monomolecules. In the early 70s, the molecules were represented  [1.8s] seen as a mirror to the structures, to the topological structures associated with physical chemical components. Now, a little digression here. This is a benzene ring, some reminiscence from chemistry. I mean, it's OK. This is a benzene ring. This is all oxygen.  [1.0s] C is carbon, so CH3 is a metal group. This type of representation here is a simplified representation that is generally used in organic chemistry and in medicinal chemistry. In general, the hydrogens are never shown.  [1.6s] Because you don't see any H left, except for this H here. Hydrogens are not written, because they are implicit, because we know, I mean, if we know which are the other atoms, we also know where are the hydrogens attached, at least if you have some knowledge you get. Then, These lines and corners are carbons, are bonds between carbs. So this corner here is a carbon atom. And these six corners in the ring are six different carbon atoms that form a dense ring. So, carbon atoms are generally not explicitly displayed in this kind of representation. They are just displayed as dots or lines. Instead, cathode atoms, atoms that are not either carbon or hydrogen, are explicitly shown. For example, O for oxygen, N for nitrogen, and the hydrogen attached are shown. In this case, I could have even avoided writing this CH3, just a point. See, for example, this. This is the 2D representation of a very complex molecule  [2.3s] It's not common because it's called calyx serenium because it has the form of a calyx, more or less. This is the 2D representation in this minimally shaped representation that is often used in  [4.0s] and medicinal chemicals. So see here, all these dots here, terminal dots, are carbon atoms with a metal attached. So they are all metal group. This is a metal, this is a metal, this is a metal, so CH3. And this is a carbon that forms for sigma bonds with other carbons and thus has no hydrogels attached.  [4.5s] I don't want to say it's clear, but more or less on the way, a little bit. And as I told you, this molecule is composed of only carbons and hydrogens except for these four oxygen atoms that are explicitly shown because they are not carbon or hydrogen.  [2.2s] The concept here is that it's not bad to use 2D representation for talking about small molecules, but the 2D representation may be misleading, or better, it's not always possible to actually deduce the three-dimensional conformation, the three-dimensional disposition of each atom, and so the actual shape of the molecule. Because I'm quite sure that if I showed you this two-limit presentation without the three-limit one, you couldn't actually conceive in your mind that this molecule had this type of structure, this type of form. It's like a cone-like structure like that. that creates a sort of hole here around this oxygen. But we're not interested in this type of molecules. And the concept is that the 2D representation of molecule, this is another small molecule, and you see we have carbons and hydrogens, then we have here one, two nitrogens, and another nitrogen here, another nitrogen, then we have sulfur, then we have two oxygens here, with a double bond to the sulfur, then we have an oxygen here and another oxygen. This is the two-destruction of the molecule, this is the corresponding three-destruction of the molecule. Now, Let's talk about color scheme. Generally, this color scheme has this CPK, and anyway,  [3.5s] What do I use to color skin in which oxygen is associated to red, nitrogen is associated to the color blue, sulfur to yellow, hydrogen to white, and carbon to either gray in general, that would be the typical color code, or any other color because, I don't know, if I want to show you two different molecules, for example,  [1.9s] Okay.  [4.7s] shade or green or orange just to show you that we are talking about two different models. In general color should be gray but  [2.3s] Since it should be easy to understand what is carbon and what is not carbon, I mean, we can use different colors for carbon, although the typical one is gray. But oxygen is always in red, nitrogen is always in this blue shade, sulfur is always in yellow shade, okay? Every time you see these colors, be sure that we're talking about oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, okay? Add outro
So to pass from the 2D structure to the 3D structure, we need to know the reciprocal spatial disposition of each atom. Because the 2D structure only informs you about the so-called connectivity of the molecule.  [2.0s] Which atom is connected to which other? So how the different atoms are connected to one another? For example, this oxygen is connected to this aromatic carbon. So this is an aromatic ring because it has the electrons in it. And also the type of connection. This is a single volume, this is a double volume. That changes the properties of the output. But the two structures completely informs us about the connectivity.  [1.2s] So this is the type of connection. But to obtain the 3D structure, we need to know how the different atoms are disposed in space reciprocally. And so this way we can understand that, for example, this ring is planar. These other two rings are fused to one another and they are planar. This ring is not planar. This is not aromantic and has a so-called chair conformation.  [1.2s] We will talk about this a little bit. I mean, just a couple of words. But it's not a planar. Anyway, we need to know the spatial disposition of the atoms. This molecule consists of 63 atoms, 63 hydrogens, 66 bonds, and 4 rings. So, I mean, it's not such an easy task without software, you know? And sometimes, I mean, Actually, you could even use hardware stereo to visualize molecules, for example, small molecules and macromolecules in 3D. So like when you went to the cinema to see Avatar the first time or any other 3D movie, and you can see before your eyes the 3D structure of macromolecules and linens. as from her  [5.7s] at present, no.  [3.8s] with little bit of training of your eye, it's easy to see the 3D features, even in an actual 2D monitor. And you will have this skill at the end of the laboratory sessions. Because you will play a little bit with your battlefield and also in molecular dynamics, so you will get some sort of skill in this way. Let's introduce the different, I mean, the most common types of representation that can be used for small molecules. This is the same small molecules displayed in four different representations. See, again, we have, in all cases, carbon and black. oxygen in red, nitrogen in blue, and hydrogen in white. This is the line representation, the easiest way to display molecules. This is also called wireframe because every atom and bond looks like this.  [1.6s] So it's a very thin line that connects the atoms, and each atom is displayed like a small dot or corner. So this is similar to this type of representation. The only difference is that we add colors, more or less. Then we have the stick representation in which atom-atom bonds are displayed as sticks, represented as tubes. So it's similar to the volume representation, but we have thicker bonds, a thicker skeleton of the molecule. And I would say that that's the most used.  [2.5s] Then we have the ball and stick representation if we want to emphasize the nuclei of the atoms with respect to the balls. In the ball and stick representation, the atoms are represented as balls and the balls between atoms are represented as sticks, as tubes. Okay?  [1.1s] Then the CPK representation follows the Cori-Polly-Colton model. The Cori-Polly-Colton model, CPK, is, on one side, the color code.  [1.4s] On the other side is this space-filled presentation in which each atom is given the Van der Waals radius. So the dimension, the volume of each atom is corresponds to the volume of the electronic cloud, okay? And that's why hydrogens have a smaller sphere. Carbon has a bigger sphere. Oxygen and nitrogen have similar spheres, but they're different. There are some differences based on the atomic value and on the gas value, okay? So there are different representations of molecules. And you can use whatever representation you want. you should use the representation that best fits the purpose. For example here, this is an image, I was using a very old paper, in which we have two different small model hills, this one in orange, this one in blue, light blue, and you see that in this case, Oxygen is always red. Sulfur is always yellow. Nitrogens are always blue. We have a purple atom that is iodine in this case. Iodine is always purple. Chlorine is green. Bromine is brown. But anyway, in this molecule, carbons are colored orange. In this other one, carbons are colored light blue. That's because we want to emphasize the difference between these two models. And one model is in thick representation and the other is in wide-frame, thick wide-frame representation. Because we want to emphasize the structural conformation of this orange one, which is a molecule that was identified through computational studies. And this white one is the reference molecule that was co-crystallized with the protein.  [1.1s] Do you know something about x-ray structures from the previous lecture?  [5.4s] Anyway, so they are x-ray structures are  [1.4s] 3D pictures of proteins, if they are structures of proteins or 3D pictures of proteins with back liver, if they are. They are called co-crystallized structure, because the liver is co-crystallized, crystallized together with the protein, okay? But, no problem. We are just giving hints, initial hints about the,  [2.0s] So, take time once. Now I can go faster because we know what we're talking about.  [3.4s] different type bonds are bonds that are formed between amino acids. Proteins are formed by amino acids. Amino acids are building blocks of the proteins. The amino acids have this general form. They are called amino acids because they have an amino group and  [1.6s] a carboxylic acid group. From the chemical point of view, they are called amino acids because they are both amino molecules and both acid molecules. The NH group is an amino group. This is a carboxylic group because it is acidic. The amino group is basic because it can get a hydrogen and become an NH3 plus molecule.  [2.9s] The carboxylic group is a C because it can give this hydrogen and become COO- with the negative charge. And the amide group of one MMS and the carboxylic group of another MMS can form a bond, see the alpha, okay, which is a peptide bond. The peptide bond is a particular amide group. And my room in Camp Street is formed by a carbonyl. group, so carbon and oxygen with a double bond, and a nitrogen here. This is a group that is particular. There are two separate things. It's a group formed by these three atoms, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, that has a specific properties that I will show you now. So the peptide bond is just an amide bond between amylases. And this amide group is formed with release of water. because this origin group is lost, this hydrogen is lost, and HOH is more, okay? So peptide bonds are just this. And the basic structure of the amino acids is a minor group from one side, carboxyl group from the other side, the so-called alpha carbon, that is the carbon that connects the amino group and the carbon-2 group. In fact, they are alpha amino acids. And then there is a side chain, R, which differs among the different amino acids. This side chain can be either short or long, either linear or branched. In that case, we can talk about branched chain amino acid. which is not interesting in our case. It's interesting if you want to gain hypertrophy, but these guys say they're particularly good for muscle hypertrophy because they are bulky and they're useful for eye synthesis. But this is just a side note. This is just to have a connection with reality, a little bit more than, so not to just talk about  [1.2s] like science fiction for years that don't have such a background in medicinal chemistry or biology or chemistry. So these alpha carbons here, the carbons that connect  [4.7s] because they are often used as the main representative of each myeloma. For example, now I will show you how to depict the process, but you can use these alpha carbons just to sketch the structure of the problem.  [1.3s] instead of representing the whole, the whole art of the structure of the portrait, you can only use the alpha colors. And so we have this type of sketch, in which every dot, every corner constitutes the alpha color. But you have to imagine that besides this, there is the rest of the background, the whole background is this, and there are also the art group, the side chains groups. There are the side chains. and you should already know that of course proteins are composed of amino acids And the amount of acids are joined by and they're translated from our names, the genetic codes. And the series of the amount of acids, the specific sequence of the amount of acids, determines ultimately the properties of the product. Because based on the sequence, we have some secondary structures. Based on the secondary structures, have some tertiary structures, you may have quaternary structures and so on. So anyway, both the structure and the properties of each protein, what determines if the protein is a receptor, is a nuclear receptor, is an enzyme, is a GPCR or something, is derived from the  [1.4s] primary sequence, like sort of what determines if I have brown hair, long hair, if I'm white, if I'm tall, if I'm not, it depends from my genetic code, sort of that.  [1.4s] So basically these products are polypeptides, so they are chains, long chains of amino acids that are folded in different forms and have different functions. Just to remind you, these are  [4.3s] different amino acids, in which you can see the amino terminals and the carboxyl terminals. This is one end, we have the protonated amino group, and the other end. And we have, yes, three alpha-amide, three carboxyl-amide. The peptide bonds, each couple of amino acids is bound through peptide bond, and we have the side chains, the automated side chains. This is a ferulone, this is an aspartate, threonine, hyaluronate, asparagine, and what so ever. Double type bond is a peculiar bond because it has a double bond character. Because the electrons, that's why this nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen based group is is  [2.0s] a single chemical group because the electrons are deletorized between nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen. So the main double bond is between carbon and oxygen, but this double bond, these electrons here, are also deletorized between the carbon and nitrogen.  [1.8s] remember something from chemistry. You see that there is free rotation around a single bond, but there is no free rotation around the double bond. What does it mean? It means that there is no, clearly, free rotation around these peptide bonds. Rotation can occur because it's not a double bond, but it has a double bond character. So, it means that this bond, so the things that are at the two sides of the box, they stay either like that, in a cis orientation, or like this. They can move. If they have a really good reason to move, for example, instead of hindrance, some unwanted interaction, they can move. But they need a very good reason. They need to get very much energy to move, because this rotation is a little bit hampered. Like, I don't know, I don't think you would never stand, I don't think you would never perform that handstand here in front of the whole classroom unless you have a very good reason.  [6.0s] And still, unless you have a very good reason, for example, you hurt yourself or something, and that's the case. There is no, I mean, there is rotation, I mean, I'm just trying to evaluate the stuff, you know, just to try to make you understand in a less straight way, but it's sort of... it's not it's not easy this rotation so imagine that around this double bond the uh  [1.6s] The rest of the minor exits, so especially the side chains, are generally displaced like that. So around the double bonds, generally the two side portions are oriented this way, in a trance way, because in this way, this bulky stuff and this other bulky stuff are far from each other. If I orient this way like that, you see here, they are bumping each other so they are jamming each other. So it's energetically unfetterable. So they tend to stay there. In some cases, they can stay also in this position, but it's less frequent. And this determines something, that in a, in a peptide group, in a peptide protein, you have multiple bonds.  [1.6s] But the peptide bond doesn't have free rotation while these other bonds have free rotation. They don't have the other bond character. And these two bonds around which there is free rotation are called phi and psi. and the disposition of the amino acid around this axis determine the whole structure of the protein. So basically, the whole structure, two-dimensional structure of the protein depends on the value of these two angles between each couple of consecutive amino acids. And in fact, there is this plot called Ramchandra plot that shows you the most common value of these C and phi atoms. And in general, in proteins, these phi of C atoms, phi of C, sorry, angles, torsional angles around, between M and S, have this value. So between, let's say, 100 and plus 100. 180 and minus 50 minus 40, let's say. Because these are the values that are most commonly found in the distribution, in the special distributions of the protein. So this is, that's what I was talking about when I told you, when I introduced you the ribbon representation.  [1.5s] This is called, this rubber stuff, rubber stuff is a protein and this green stuff is a small molecule. Is this clear at least? I mean, is this easy for you to understand that this green stuff is a small molecule, a chemical compound, and this other thing is a protein? Okay, that's, that's good. Okay, it's not true. Okay, for now it's more than enough. So, this is called, The representation, and you can tell that this is a stick representation of the molecule, right? It's not that big. I mean, we're watching this far from the distance, but it's a stick. It's not a wireframe. Not even a ball of stick, not even a CDK, that's all. So, this re-representation is called like that because it, with modern imagination, it looks like the reverb, you know, of a present box or something.  [1.4s] We can find different three-dimensional elements in this presentation. Red stuff are alpha helices, light blue stuff are B-sheets, and gray stuff are loops. You should already know from the previous lectures what an alpha helix is. It is a right-handed coil of spiral conformation. There is  [1.4s] by the fact that each marimba, say you see that, the backward, the image backward of each marimba, say,  [6.9s] Now, do you know what's a hydrogen bond? Yes. You can say no, no problem. Do you know what's hydrogen bond?  [3.4s] It's an electrostatic interaction between a polarized hydrogen that is polarized because it is bound to a molecular negative atom  [4.9s] is the interaction between this polarized hydrogen with the lone pair of an atom that is called an acceptor. So the NH group, or OH group, generally, is the hydrogen-borne donor, because it donates the proton, the hydrogen, and this is the carbonyl is the acceptor, because it accepts the proton, because the nucleus of the hydrogen is the proton. And this is an initial acceptor, because it has a lone pair. It has two lone pairs, two couplets of electrons flowing in space, they are greedy of the protons. So when there is a proton in the surrounding, the proton is positive. If the electron cloud is negative, so they form a sort of single bond. It's not a natural bond like between carbon and nitrogen or carbon and carbon. There is a strong electrostatic interaction, but the hydrogen is the localized between. the actual atom that is connected to the hydrogen and the other atom that's below there. Because these electrons in space cause it somehow that's a really strong and important interaction. is really important in molecular modeling in general for two reasons. First because, thanks to this interaction,  [1.8s] and thus the whole structure of the protein occurs. Then it stems to these hydrogen bonds that the DNA and RNA double strands are formed. DNA double strands are formed because there are either two or three different hydrogen bonds between the nucleotides, the bases of nucleotides. You know something? And also, because they are directional interactions, so they are interactions that have a specific direction, and they are important for the ligand to be recognized by the proton. But we will talk about this later. For now, hydrogen bonds, let's say hydrogen bonds in proteins, they are the basis of the secondary structure, like alpha helix here.  [1.3s] Because, thanks to hydrogen bonds formed by ammonium acids that are at four positions of distance, we can obtain this coil structure, which is an alpha head. This is an all-mountain representation of only the bedrock of the peptide, because we only have the peptide group and the alpha carbon. This is the full atom where we have the bedrock.  [2.8s] the representation of the hand. Okay? Instead, in binosheets or binostrands, we have linear strands of amino acids that form a series of H-bonds, like in a hinge. You know? It's like a zip. It's like a zip. They can be either parallel or antiparallel. The antiparallel binosheet, like this one, is probably the most common. These arrows, I mean, these video sheets are represented as arrows because in this case, the protein sequence goes from left to right, then there is a loop here, and then it goes right to left. So they are antiparallel because one series of rescues, typically three to ten, goes this side,  [2.3s] and the other one goes to that side and they are zipped together thanks to this hydrogen bond. So no hydrogen bonds, no helix, no helices, no bigger sheets, no secondary structure, nothing. No hydrogen bonds. Without any hydrogen bond, each protein will be a screen of a manifest, completely useless.  [1.0s] So we owe our life to other components somehow. And now that you know something more about the secondary structures of causing, you can interpret a little bit better the Brown-Sheldon plot, because this  [2.6s] Ramshackle plot is actually a sort of hit map, and this area of the Ramshackle plot, this populated area, is the area of the values of the common 3MC angles that my message have in B2 squares. This is the values assumed by the rescues that are in right-handed analytics. And these are the area that others assume in left handed atlas, but they're very rare, we know. Okay? And because, I mean, doesn't matter. So, if we consider everything, ribbons, penis sheets, and loops, what are loops? Loops are portions of, of, Only peptides and proteins that remain as strains. They have no secondary structure. They don't form any particular beach bond. Maybe in a term, in a hair film, they form some beach bond that maintains the hair film form, but they're not characterized by specific patterns of beach bond. And in fact, they are blue, they are blue. No secondary structure. So here you see that, you see the river of precipitation of the X-ray structure of the protein. I can tell you that it's an enzyme and it's a kinase because I recognize the catalytic, the structure of the catalytic side. You don't care at all. So anyway, it's the river of precipitation and you can spot some heresies, you can spot some Add outro
you can spot some loops, and it has a different calling just because it's something that you can do with CanVLog, the software that I make use, and this calling code is just because it gives you a hint of the direction of the sequence of the crossing and the different secondary structures. This is a distance of the head, this is a distance of the head, and so on. But the hard part of this is when you, and you will do this, when you download this x-ray structure, which is a 3D picture of a protein, and you open it with a viewer, for example, like you will do,  [1.5s] What actually the software reads to show you the 3D structure that you can work with? It actually reads this. A series of text files that you can open with a text editor. Simple text file. And, this is our software. What are these components? This is  [1.2s] Atom, the first column. Intense, the softer, there are atoms.  [4.9s] Otherwise, you will find head atom, which tells you the software, this is not a protein atom. This is something different. It could be solvent, it could be co-crystallization part of some iron, it could be some ligand, it could be some surfactant, something that is not a carbon monoxide. These five columns here are related to the type of monoxide.  [1.9s] different left and right. This is the number of the amino acid. This is the amino acid five, amino acid six, amino acid seven. What type of amino acid? An arginine, a propylene, a threonine. And these are the corresponding atoms. N-C-A-C-O. These are called atom types. I will tell you later what are these things. They don't just tell you. us and so which type of atom nitrogen carbon oxygen so which element of the type of atom n is the nitrogen in the peptide bond c a is the alpha carbon the one that connects the two peptides  [1.3s] C and O are the carbon and the oxygen in the carbonyl group of the peptide bonds. These C, B, C, G, C, D, N, etc, etc. are the atoms in the side chains. Okay? So it means that if I look here, I read that the seventh amino acid is a threonine and the The peptide bond of the three-winged is made of this N, this C, and this O, which are the 19th atom, the 21st atom, and the 27th atom of the P structure. This is just the consecutive number of the atoms. Just tell you in the, I mean, in the, consecutive numbering, which is the number of numbers. And A is the chain. Chain A, chain B. Normally, if you have one chain, so just one structure in the PDP, let's simplify this, you have one chain and it's chain A. Just because A is the personality of the other. You could be chain X sometimes. Then, This portion, these are the three columns, are simply the three coordinates in the Cartesian space of each atom. X, Y, Z. That's why you can't reconstruct the structure of the whole quality, because for each atom you have the coordinated space. One, two, three, four, five. If you combine the bandwidth, the software combines everything, it gets the full structure, okay? These other two numbers are Flash Studio and  [1.5s] they tell you the number of conformations identified by the amino acids. Sometimes the amino acids are annoying because they don't stay in just a single conformation but they flip, they go right to that. So they may have multiple conformation in the exostructure. In this case, none of them has two different conformation because one is like 100% in the same conformation. This number is called temperature factor beta factor. It tells you how flexible is the residue within the exostructure. With level 50, the flexibility is not that much, and this is good because if it's not that much, we can identify properly where the amylase is, where the side chain is. If it's too flexible, we don't see a precise structure, we see a problem.  [1.3s] Like when you take a picture of me while waving, if you picture me with the right exposition of the camera, very short, you see me either in this position or in that one. But if you use a longer exposition of the camera, you see me wrong. You see a cloud, a pink cloud, that shape because you can't precisely recognize a specific position. And that's the concept of resolution in X-ray structure. What is the resolution of the X-ray structure? If the X-ray and X-ray structure is the 3D picture of a protein or a macromolecule or something, the resolution is the sharpness of the picture.  [2.6s] let's say, I mean, it's, can you please leave, tell me, the lower is the resolution the better, because, imagine that's, let's take to the example, you know, of me waving a new technology. And in this case, if you take a, imagine you are taking an extra structure from me, if the resolution is,  [1.3s] 15 centimeters, it means that you're able to discriminate the exact position of something that is in the range of 15 centimeters. So, you understand where is my hand, but if I'm doing this, you see my hand in a precise position, but you see it all in my hand. You don't see with where each finger is. If you have a resolution of two centimeters, it means that you can spot positions in a random two centimeter. So if i'm doing this, you take a picture, you see exactly where is my hand and where is each of my fingers. Because you can see, you can spot differences within two centimeters, okay? That's why  [1.2s] the lower the resolution, the better. For example, if I'm taking a picture like that, the resolution of an X-ray sculpture is most of times not so good to let you identify the position of the hydrogens. Because the hydrogens have such a small nucleus that is actually a continent. Such a small. So you're not able to understand where they are. But you will care because if you In most cases, if you know what the heavy items are  [5.9s] It's like having a picture like this, a picture of a car. You don't know if a woman or a man is driving the car, but you see that there's someone inside the car. You see where the stop lights are, the turn-in lights are, where the wheels are, and even though the position of each small piece of the car is not so sharp, but you can draw a picture of the sky easily. And that's the same with the X-ray structure. Generally, with an X-ray structure, you see an electronic cloud, and if the resolution is sufficiently small, you can recognize the shape of the environment and build the X-ray structure.  [2.0s] So where you can find X-ray structures in the protein of the man, you can find up to date more than 250,000 X-ray structures among structures of, or better, structures of, X-ray structures of the protein, X-ray structures of our nucleic acids, ribozymes, coagulase structures, and in my structures, I'm not going to tell you names. We don't care. Anyway, structures.  [1.1s] If you go to a product like that, for example, if you type here, and you will do this,  [3.6s] structures, these are identified by a full character code. like that. If you type in the search bar 1-Y-O-U, you can find this PEB structure, which is the crystal structure of a catalytic domain of MMP-15, matrix metallocrylonase-13, complex with content P-U-B-P-1-P-D-2. I mean, it's a very bad structure, obviously. It's a spiral compound. Anyway,  [1.1s] Here you have the description of the structure, which protein with which pigment. And here you have the resolution, which is 2.3 angstrom. That's rather good. Between 2 and 3 angstrom is good enough, because you can spot precisely coordinates of atoms within 2-3 angstrom of distance. and imagine that a carbon-carbon bond is around, is less than two thunderstorms. So anyway, you can see a very, very sharp image, but you can see an image which is sufficiently sharp to detect the, all the movement of the other. If you have a resolution below two, say 1.4, 1.3, you're also able to spot the ambulance. So there are extra structures in such a good resolution, which is such low, 1.3, that you can actually spot the hydrogens. If you have a resolution above 3, it's not that good because maybe, yeah, you see, for example, for some residues with long side chains, very flexible, you don't see the proper disposition of the side chain. And in some cases, the side chains are truncated. This is the amount of acid, it moves too fast, so in the structure we don't have the whole chain, we just have the first beta carbon, the first carbon. So this is an important thing. Then in the page related to each X-ray structure, you can find  [7.2s] you find A and B. It means that you find two structures in the same, in the same, two protein objects in the same structure. But they are the same problem. Just that in the crystal, they were deodorized. Just because in the crystal, they were packed. Then you see the sequence left. It's a protein of 168 amino acids. It's from Homo sapiens, from us. We have this There are no mutations, sometimes some residues are mutated to facilitate the crystallization, for example. The gene is this, and you can find other stuff inside the product. For example, this is the structure of this pyro compound. This is, you see, this is the chemical name of the compound 5,2-litoxiatine 5,4,4-fluorothinoxytinoxytrimidate 2,4,6,1-H,8,5-H-finoxytrimidate okay, it's a barrier, but anyway, this is the chemical name, we're not interested in this but this is the ligand, this is the small molecule that binds this protein and inhibits it I can tell that it's ligand Then we can find something else. For example, a sulfate ion is just an ion that was in the solution used to create the crystal. It's there by chance, let's say. Then we have calcium ions and zinc ions. Ions may be there because used in the solving solutions, even in the solution to create the crystal, but they can be prosthetic groups, so they can be cofactors of the protein. And in this case, the zinc ion is the metal that is used for the activity of the protein. Some of the amino acids of the protein bind this metal, the metal interacts with the substrate and changes the substrate to transform it into another thing. This happens in this motion. They are called prosthetic groups or prophopters. They can be metals, they can be other non-vectile molecules,  [4.2s] that does not belong to the protein is listed here, like a non-protein. And in the X-ray structure, these atoms are labeled as heptatoms, because they are not atoms. But then, before concluding this lecture, how about molecules? This is, of course, not a protein. It's a small molecule.  [2.0s] This is, which atom is this? I don't care if you say Jupiter. Which atom is this? And also this and this. Which atom is this? The white ones? The blue one?  [3.9s] It's foreign. You know what I mean? I know that because it's small. I mean, I can use it by the length of water, but of course it's not. Anyway, chlorine and fluorine are different shades of red water. And in the camera palette, this is called, this color shade is called tan.  [1.9s] at this stage. Anyway, this time,  [4.2s] So this is, these are plantar rings, so they are all aromatic rings, this is a tannin ring, this is a pyridine ring, this is a roxy pyridine ring, so it's a pyridine and a pyridine ring, but you don't care, they are all aromatic rings and they're plantar, that's it. I'll show you what is actually behind the structure of the protein.  [1.1s] in PDP format because I mean that  [5.7s] And instead, a different type of file format is used for small molecules. Actually, we can use different types of formats. The most common one is the No2 format. And the No2 format is another text file, which is not absolutely different from the  [1.5s] It has some advantages. In the first column, imagine that this block and this other block are one after the other. So this is not an actual file. We have this, and below this, we have this. I will show you that in the next time. So this column, again, we have the sequential number of the different atoms.  [1.5s] the number of the atoms which is actually available I mean this 012, NO7, CO1 is just a software that assign these names but it could be called Julio, John, Mary or something I mean  [3.8s] Every column starts with a C, and every column starts with an O, but the number is random. These two columns are the spatial coordinates, the coordinates of the properties of space, x, y, z. This is the real important thing, because it's the atom type. Again, this is the second time you hear this. I will show you then exactly what it is, because it tells you which type of number. For example, we have  [2.6s] I can't show you the difference anyway. Anyway, the atom types, if it's aromatic carbon, non-aromatic carbon, oxygen or something, we will talk about this later. Then this is one, the sequential number, it's always one, it's monolithic because molecules are not... Not the 20, another thing. FBH is the name, is a three-letter code. It could be called Julia, the same, or June, three letters. This is the partial charge.  [1.4s] This is the partial charge that is associated to each atom, something that in the PDB file you don't have. Because every atom is polarized, as in the peptide bond, and so every atom has a specific partial charge. Some atoms are polarized positively, some are polarized negatively. For example, in the NH group of the tides, the hydrogen of the NH group is positively polarized. polarized, then nothing is negatively polarized, and that's why the N-H group is dipole, and is a group that can act as an H-bomb dome, because it's polarized. Clear? If it's not clear, tell me, no problem. And this other stuff here is information related to the bonds.  [1.1s] Bond No. 1, Atom 1 binds to Atom 2 with a single bond. Bond No. 2, Atom 2 binds to Atom 3 with an automatic bond. Bond No. 3, Atom 2 binds to Atom 17 with automatic bond, etc., etc. So,  [1.2s] You could already tell me the two main differences between PDP file and multiple files. Since I'm good, I'm not going to ask you, I'm going to tell you directly the answer because I understand that you're tired of this new information. The two differences are partial charge and bond information. In the PDB file, there is no problem with partial charge, but, interestingly, there is no bound information. There is no connectivity. You just have the sequential number of atoms, the atom type, something that tells you which type of element, I forgot, this is just the element.  [1.1s] Which type of atom is alpha carbon, peptide nitrogen, etc. Which is the amino acid associated to, which is the number, the coordinates, but there is no one big condition. Why? Because amino acids are always the same. The structure of an amino acid is always the same. And also, this means that the connection between, if you take a nitrogen, each nitrogen of the side chain, each carbon, each hydrogen,  [1.2s] They're always bound to one another in the same way. So the connections are always the same. The number and type of atoms are always the same. The bonds are always the same. There are some double bonds, some single bonds. The partial charges actually are not always the same, but predominantly, since they're due to the bonds, let's say, in this way, they're more or less always the same.  [1.7s] The software has an easy task in taking in mind all these things, because it just needs to memorize 22, 26, and minor acids, depending on whether we're talking about a classic minor acid and modified minor acid anyway. But once the software knows the structure of each single minor acid, it doesn't have to analyze the partial charge or the connection, because it's always the same. If the software reads, this is an arginine, and we have MCA all atoms in an arginine, the software says, okay, I don't really know how these atoms are connected. I already know where there is a single or double bond. I already know which is aromatic, which atom is aromatic, which is not. Which is positively charged, which is negatively charged. So it doesn't need to to get this information. Instead, a viewer and a software that has to manage small molecules needs to be informed about this, needs to have this information, because all molecules are different. So, there is no, I mean,  [1.3s] It can be, I mean, maybe the software knows how a family ring is. If you just need to say automatic and it knows, but you have to tell the software how will the format  [3.7s] Because, for example, in this case, the bond between this nitrogen and this oxygen is a single bond. And if you write a double bond here, you can have a positively charged oxygen, which is a very weird piece, you know? But it's possible.  [1.0s] So it's not... That's why we have to instruct the software about the connectivity, the connection, and the partial charge, which is not important for the MIMO-ACID because the MIMO-ACID always have the same structures. And we officially finished the first lecture. Now, first of all, do you have questions, curiosities?  [1.0s] Good.  [5.5s] Don't hate me. I mean, I know that it's what I'm saying is fucking background. I will try to take it easy. But if you don't hate me that much, and if you're not so tired, I will introduce the next lecture. Just because when the game is harder, I can slow down and let you absorb better information.  [2.1s] May I start with the next lecture? Okay. When you're done, you can, we're done. Okay? But I will talk for another 15 minutes. Okay? Okay?  [9.8s] Do you have another lecture after this? Luckily not. So we will see each other next Monday, right? Tomorrow you will have another lecture with Ani. No, I think tomorrow... Ani, you had another lecture before mine. Today, yes? Yeah, yeah. Today, the professor is also here. So tomorrow we don't have that. So we'll see each other with no gaps next Monday. But you know what happens on next Thursday, right? We are in pharmacy department with you. From 2.60 am to 5.00 am. We will start with laboratory. We will have half of the afternoon with lecture and the other half with laboratory exercise. And the department is pharmacy, so  [1.4s] It's the main dress of the main building. Actually, the room is on the other side. But you can choose. If you prefer, I can wait for you at the entrance of the main building, with the white stuff, with the stairs, with the white stairs. And we can go all together to the . We can do this. We can talk about this next Monday again. But the only important thing is that you know that next Thursday, you are booked for the whole afternoon. with me and the same will be the following Thursday, okay? And then unfortunately we're done with the recording because I couldn't afford providing you more than one or three lectures without the necessary lectures, you know, because I need to tell you some.  [2.1s] So don't worry, I won't be that strict when I ask you the topics and give you the sound, so you don't need to be that precise. General concepts are okay. You need to tell something, and you need to be a little bit specific, but not, for example, I'm not asking you, what do you find in the seventh column of opinion structure?  [2.7s] I can ask you, for example, when can you  [3.8s] with actions and coordinates, number of options, and type of.  [3.2s] The rest of you, etc, etc. Okay? Molecular energies. Let's give a piece. I told you that if you think about yourself as a molecule, this will make things much easier. Because even though you're not used to think about it, Here, actually, our situation is actually not far from . That is, when you Add outro
[9.3s] in space, you are an object in space. You are a 3D object in a 3D space and a 3D reality. And during your day, you generally, you never thought about this in this thermodynamic point, but you always assume different disposition in space. You have one disposition now, I was associated to another disposition before, I was sitting in my chair, and now I'm assuming a different one because I'm standing still in front of you. Then I'm walking and I'm constantly changing my disposition. We will also study this with molecular dynamics. For now overall, we need to understand what happens from the point of view of static  [2.5s] snapshots first, and then we can understand how to analyze something more better. So, generally, I'm trying to take it easy because I'm very short-sighted, but it's actually like that. Imagine that molecules would say they exist in reality, in space. They have a 3D structure, but a molecule doesn't assume the same 3D structure always. They're like us. They're like us. They can assume different confirmation because they have different flexibilities. Because for example in real life older people have lower flexibility. The younger you are, the higher your flexibility. And similarly, different molecules have different flexibility. So some molecules may be more flexible and may assume a wider range of conformation, a disposition space. Some molecules are more rigid and can assume a smaller kind of conformation. But the first thing to mention is that Each molecule can assume multiple conformations in space. And we have to address this issue. So we can't consider molecules like rigid entities. We have to consider different conformations. And the way, I mean, the solution is to consider that each conformation is associated to energy. Energy is associated to conformation, conformation is associated to energy. And it is exactly like this. Because if I'm standing here, I'm assuming a conformation that is associated to a different energy with respect to this. Because now I'm here and I don't need to use my legs to stand still. I have my arms relaxed. If I'm here, if I'm like this, I'm associating to a different conformation. To stand still, I need to use my legs, my muscles. If I deactivate my muscles, I'm gone. So this confirmation, for sure, is associated to a higher amount of internal energy, which in the molecular mechanics can be called internal energy or strain energy, like the strain in the muscle that we use for standing still.  [1.2s] If I try to, I don't know, handstand or assume another conformation, for example this one, of course this conformation is more strained because I have to put so much strength in my leg to stay like this. So this conformation is associated to a higher amount of internal energy, respect to standing still. My strained energy is a lot. because the pressure in my muscle is big. And so this is an unwanted conformation. If I can, I switch to this other conformation. And if I can, because it's not necessary to stand still, I can switch to an even lower energy conformation. If I was home, I could relax in my bed and So, laying in my bed, I have to assume a ground-bound minimum conformation, because there's no other conformation in which I can relax anymore, because I'm standing there, so I don't need to use any muscle to stand there. So, I have, I can assume different conformation, well, a minimum. So, when you lay in your bed, you are at the lowest minimum. Okay? Because there's no other confirmation associated to a lower amount of energy. When you're, when you sit, I mean, you don't need to use that energy in your muscle. I would say it is a local minimum. It's still a minimum because you're comfortable, but it's not the lowest one. Okay? And you may have other local, I mean, I'm already  [3.2s] I'm already talking about some hints of confirmation of another. But if you follow the argument, I think it would be easier. Now let's just introduce this stuff like this in a larger object. So if you think about this daily, you assume some low energy conformation and high energy conformation. Always. And low energy conformation are, of course, so every conformation is associated to an energy. Because depending on the disposition in space, you have to assume you need to use a specific amount of energy, okay? And the lower energy, the modular relax, the lower energy you need. So we assume a lower conformation. Of course, if you can choose between multiple conformation, which conformation you would choose?  [2.2s] this one, or this one, or when you're in bed, do you sit in bed or do you sleep laying on the bed, laying on the mattress? I think so, yeah. So if you can choose, if you have the option to choose, you would choose for the lower energy, the lowest energy confirmation possible, right? In this case, you can't lay down because, I don't know, it's not that, it's impossible, I mean it's, I wouldn't be professional if I were to talk to you laying down and you wouldn't be professional. So you can't use this one, but you choose the lowest conformation possible, because standing, I mean, sitting in the chair is not bad, so, which is this. And the same happens for the molecule. Each molecule, each conformation of the molecule is associated to an amount of energy, and the molecule choose the conformation associated to the lower, the lowest amount of energy, if possible. They assume different conformation. And, something that is very interesting, and something I'm sure you've never thought about is that, of course, when you pass from a lower energy conformation to a higher energy conformation, you increase your energy. And there is an energy barrier associated to this movement because I'm sitting in the chair and I have to use the power of the muscle to get up.  [2.7s] What happens when you sit down? What happens when you sit down? You don't usually sit down like this. Or you sit down like this. You generally do this. And... When you do this, for example, it's easy. When you sit down, so you pass from a higher energy level to a lower energy level, you still need to pass from a... to overcome the energetic bubble, to pass a transition step, because in between standing still, higher energy level, and sitting lower energy level, you need to do this. So, when you are here, it's not easy for you to stay here. You need a lot of energy to cross, you know, to do this movement. So if you stay here, of course you need a lot of energy. And this is a transition state. A state that is assumed only transiently, because you never stay like this. You stay like this only for a second, and that's soon to pass from a higher or lower energy level to another one. No matter if I sit down or if I get up, I still pass from this transition state, but only for a second, because this state is associated to a lower energy. And you want to sit there alone. And that happens for the moment. So no matter if you walk back or forth from conformer one, lower energy, You still need to cross an energy bar and a transition state. And, another stop, you need to have, what's the time? Okay.  [3.7s] Because each time,  [7.5s] If I don't have enough energy to cross the transition state, to overcome the energy barrier, I have to stay there. And also, if I don't have that much energy, I can't even  [1.1s] sit down, because otherwise my leg will implode and I will fall down. So, if I don't have enough energy to cross this barrier, I stay in the same seat. Of course, the energy barrier is lower.  [5.5s] to the previous one, okay? But this is something that happens in small molecule, in bigger molecules, and also in proteins.  [1.0s] So this happens for simple rotations around bonds, for bigger conformational changes of the model, and even for very, very large range movements, like domains of protein that opens and close to bind to a ligand. And that's, for example, you know that while around a peptide bond, there is no rotation, because the bond is so hamper really has a double bond character that the molecule would need so much energy to rotate that on the end the energy is so large for example there is another molecule pushing or there is such a strong interaction that drives the molecule only in some specific cases there is rotation around this one and there are two preferred conformations last thing I don't know.  [2.0s] Yeah, it can be your type or your, I don't know, a heavy world. And only if, I don't know, if either somebody grabs you and gives you the strength, or you say, okay, it's unbearable, I can't stay here, it's so hot, I can't stay here, I look at the manager, it's so bad, I have to run, and you run. But let's be specific, let's say, in example. I take it easy. This is n. Last thing, and I'll conclude. Based on the difference in energy, thanks to the Boltzmann equation, we're not going into the details, but you have to know that if you know the difference in energy between two conformational states, you can predict the distribution of the conformation in one molecule. For example, you know that if two conformations have an energy difference of 5.5 kilojoules per mole from conformation A, which is the lower conformation, and conformation B is the higher level conformation, means that conformation B has an internal energy 5.5 kilojoules per mole higher than conformation B, you already know that at the temperature  [1.0s] at a temperature of 25 degrees, the molecule that can assume conformation A and B for 90% assumes conformation A and 90% conformation B. This means that, for example, that if I'm very tired and I'm supposed to to show something that needs me to stay standing still, and sometimes needs me to be sitting here. If I'm extremely tired, then most 90% of time I sit, and 10% of time I stand still. If I'm not that tired, or if the energy value is not that high, for example, if sitting means I have to sit here, and so on. Getting up is associated to a big energetic difference. I don't do this so many times. But instead, if I sit here, small energy barrier between this and this. And so, for example, 40% of the time I stay like this. No, 40% of the time I stay like this. 60% of the time I prefer low energy confirmation. In the other way, once I've set I don't want to get up because the energy bar is too high. So 90% of the time I stay here, 10% of the time if I really need to get up for showing something, I stay up. And that's the same thing.  [4.0s] But actually, at the molecular level, the higher the temperature, the higher the energy, the thermal friction, let's say, the thermal energy and the the easier the change between one confirmation to another. Well, you don't need to do this. The take home message is this. So I want you to be advised to compare molecule as yourself because everything will be easier in the next step. So if I talk in five minutes,  [5.8s] If you have a curiosity or something, you can ask me next time because you're tired, I know. But don't worry. And we will see each other next Monday at 9. Okay? Okay. Have a nice weekend. Add outro
