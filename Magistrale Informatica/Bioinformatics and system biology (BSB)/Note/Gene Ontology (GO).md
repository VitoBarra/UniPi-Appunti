# Gene Ontology (GO)
---
Gene Ontology (GO) What is GO? • A controlled vocabulary to describe what genes/proteins do. • Same terms used across species → enables cross-species comparison. Three main branches • Biological Process (BP) – “What larger process is this gene involved in?” e.g. cell cycle, apoptosis, immune response • Molecular Function (MF) – “What does this gene product do at the molecular level?” e.g. kinase activity, DNA binding • Cellular Component (CC) – “Where in the cell is it active?” e.g. nucleus, mitochondrion, plasma membrane Structure • Organized as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) – Terms have parent / child relationships (is-a, part-of). – A gene can be annotated with multiple GO terms at different levels of specificity. • Manually annotated by a large consortium • Data come from experimental and computational analyses
